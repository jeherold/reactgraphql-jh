# RepoInfo Component Fix

## Issues Identified:

1. The inline prop type definition in the function arguments was incorrect.
2. The `RepoInfo` component tried to destructure and type the `repo` prop inline, which caused confusion.

## Solution:

### 1. Define the props type:

```typescript
type RepoInfoProps = {
  repo: Repository;
};
```

### 2. Use the props type for the component:

```typescript
const RepoInfo: React.FC<RepoInfoProps> = ({ repo }) => {
  //...
};
```

## Fixed `RepoInfo` Component:

```typescript
import React from "react";
import { Repository } from './types/Repository.js';

type RepoInfoProps = {
  repo: Repository;
};

const RepoInfo: React.FC<RepoInfoProps> = ({ repo }) => {
  return (
    <li className="list-group-item">
      <a className="h5 mb-0 text-decoration-none" href={repo.url}>
        {repo.name}
      </a>
      <div className="small">{repo.description}</div>
    </li>
  );
};

export default RepoInfo;
```

**Note**:

- The `key={repo.key}` inside the `RepoInfo` component's `li` tag was removed. The key is already being provided at the point of using the component (`<RepoInfo key={repo.id} repo={repo} />`).
- The `href` attribute was fixed by changing `href="{repo.url}"` to `href={repo.url}`. Using curly braces inside double quotes treats the URL as a string and doesn't evaluate it.
